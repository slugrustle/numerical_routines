# numerical\_routines

This repository holds efficient routines for performing rounded division and shift operations. These routines are intended for programmers who use fixed point arithmetic on microcontrollers or other constrained devices.

I may add a variety of other numerical routines if time permits.

## Getting Started

Presently, everything interesting is in the integer directory.

## Contributing

I would love to receive bug reports and user feedback. If you have improvements to the code, please get in touch.

## Acknowledgment

[boost](https://www.boost.org/) provides, among other things, high precision floating point types that made the test programs and helper utility in the integer directory much easier to develop.
