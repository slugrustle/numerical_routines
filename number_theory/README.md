## gcd

Returns the greatest common divisor of the two input integers.

## lcm

Returns the least common multiple of the two input integers. Throws an std::overflow_error exception instead if the result would overflow the range of the output type.

## general

The gcd and lcm routines are defined for uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t types.
