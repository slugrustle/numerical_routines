At the time of writing, wikipedia has a good page on this algorithm at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITP_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITP_method).

ITP_solve.m has only been lightly tested in GNU/Octave, but it should also work in Matlab. See the comment at the top of the file for usage information.
